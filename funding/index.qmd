### Active Grants

#### PaleoPAL: An AI Research Assistant for Paleoclimatology
**Lead PI:** Deborah Khider
**NSF Award:** ICER 2425885 (co-PI)
**Period:** 01/01/2025 -- 12/31/2027

[PaleoPAL](https://medium.com/cyberpaleo/introducing-paleopal-your-ai-partner-in-paleoclimate-research-3d8d0d79a09c) is an AI system that incorporates paleolimate knowledge into existing large language models, creating a research assistant tool to help scientists perform various tasks to analyze paleoclimate data. A key feature is that PaleoPAL will assist researchers not only with data analysis but also the interpretation of their research. Critical thinking still required. 

#### FROGS: Facilitating Reproducible Open GeoScience
**Lead PIs:** Deborah Khider, David Edge
**NSF Award:** RISE 2324732/2324733
**Period:** 01/01/2024 -- 06/30/2026

[FROGS](https://medium.com/cyberpaleo/frogs-facilitating-reproducible-and-open-geoscience-bf3f786bdff1) promotes FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) research practices in the geosciences. The project delivers two main components: (1) [LeapFROGS](https://linked.earth/LeapFROGS/), an interactive online learning platform offering self-paced modules on science practice and publishing in both Python and R, and (2) synchronous hackathons and workshops to train geoscientists in incorporating reproducible workflows into their research. Results of this reproducible research are being showcased at [AGU 2025]()

#### PaleoCube: Enabling Cloud-Based Paleoclimatology
**PIs:** Deborah Khider, Julien Emile-Geay, Nicholas McKay 
**NSF Award:** ICER 2126510
**Period:** 09/01/2021 -- 08/31/2026\

PaleoCube lowers social and technical barriers in paleoclimatology by bringing scientists to work in the Cloud. The project extends existing cyberinfrastructure (LinkedEarth, Pangeo, Jupyter) and the scientific Python ecosystem to provide free access to interactive computing at scale. Key components include: (1) a knowledge base for paleoclimate records supporting complex querying, (2) software to query and manipulate LiPD datasets, (3) software libraries for analyzing paleoclimate time series, and (4) a [gallery of exemplar notebooks and tutorials](https://linked.earth/PaleoBooks/index.html). A major achievement has been to extend NumPy and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) to accommodate non-nanosecond dtypes, thereby [opening pandas to the 4.5 billion years of Earth's history](https://quansight.com/post/pandas-and-the-geosciences-a-4-5-billion-year-story/).

#### PReSto: A Paleoclimate Reconstruction Storehouse
**PIs:** Nick McKay (NAU), Julien Emile-Geay (USC), Deborah Khider (ISI)
**NSF Award:** EAR 1948822
**Period:** 07/01/2020 -- 06/30/2026\
[PReSto](https://paleopresto.com) provides broad access to paleoclimate reconstructions through an integrated web-based platform. The project connects a steadily growing digital collection of paleoclimate data to evolving methodologies and effectively visualizes results through a web portal. PReSto pilots on two complementary time periods: the Common Era (past 2,000 years) with monthly and annual records, and the Holocene (past ~12,000 years) at lower temporal resolution. The project includes capacity-building workshops for data stewards and early-career researchers.

#### Belmont Forum Collaborative Research: Abrupt Change in Climate and Ecosystems: Where are the Tipping Points?
**Award:** Belmont Forum via NSF, ICER 1929554
**Period:** 07/01/2019 -- 06/30/2022\

#### Collaborative Research: LinkedEarth: Crowdsourcing Data Curation & Standards Development in Paleoclimatology
**NSF Award:** ICER 1541029 
**PIs:** Julien Emile-Geay, Yolanda Gil, Nick McKay
**Period:** 09/01/2015 -- 08/31/2019\

#### Collaborative Research: GeoChronR - open-source tools for the analysis, visualization and integration of time-uncertain geoscientific data
**NSF Award:** EAR 1347213
**PIs:** Nick McKay, Julien Emile-Geay
**Period:** 07/01/2014 -- 06/30/2018\

[GeoChronR](http://nickmckay.org/GeoChronR/) is an integrated framework in the R language that allows scientists to generate state-of-the-art age models for their records, create time-uncertain ensembles of their data, analyze those ensembles with a number of commonly-used techniques, and visualize their results in an intuitive way. This grant funded the development of the package, as well as 2 workshops (2016, 2017 in Flagstaff, AZ) to disseminate its use. In parallel, GeoChronR motivated the creation of the [Linked Paleo Data (LiPD)](https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1093-2016) framework, which is at the root of many LinkedEarth data endeavors.
