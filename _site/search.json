Recognizing that sharing research data, software, and workflows is fundamental to building a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) open science ecosystem, FROGS has delivered training events that combine synchronous hackathons with weeks of practical exercises, allowing participants at various career stages to integrate publishing principles directly into their research workflows. Throughout these follow-up periods, office hours provide personalized support as researchers apply new skills to their own projects, ensuring lasting impact beyond the initial workshop. To support both workshop participants and the broader geoscience community, FROGS developed LeapFROGS, a free interactive platform with curated lecture materials and self-graded exercises in Python and R that enables self-paced learning on science practice and publishing.

A key feature is that PaleoPAL will assist researchers not only with data analysis but also the interpretation of their research. Critical thinking still required.\nBlog posts: Announcing PaleoPAL\n\n\nTUPS: Table Understanding for Paleoclimate Studies\nLead PIs: Deborah Khider, Jay Pujara, Nicholas McKay NSF AWARD: OAC - 2411267/2411268 Period: 09/01/2024 - 08/31/2027\nTUPS uses machine learning-powered table understanding to dramatically reduce the time paleoclimatologists spend searching for, wrangling, and annotating datasets before analysis. The project delivers a Python toolbox (PyleoTUPS) that enables scientists to query the NOAA Paleoclimatology and PANGAEA archives, automatically returning datasets as ready-to-use Pandas DataFrames. Beyond streamlining access to major repositories, TUPS can parse untemplated Excel and CSV files, using deep learning to intelligently extract essential metadata such as variable names, units, and geographical locations—transforming messy data into analysis-ready formats with minimal manual intervention.\nBlog posts: Announcing TUPS, PyleoTUPS\n\n\nFROGS: Facilitating Reproducible Open GeoScience\nLead PIs: Deborah Khider, Julien Emile-Geay, Nicholas McKay NSF Award: RISE 2324732/2324733 Period: 01/01/2024 – 06/30/2026\nFROGS promotes FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) research practices in the geosciences. The project delivers two main components: (1) LeapFROGS, an interactive online learning platform offering self-paced modules on science practice and publishing in both Python and R, and (2) synchronous hackathons and workshops to train geoscientists in incorporating reproducible workflows into their research. Results of this reproducible research are being showcased at AGU 2025.\nBlog posts: FROGS on Medium, LeapFROGS\nPublications: Khider et al. (2025)\n\n\nPaleoCube: Enabling Cloud-Based Paleoclimatology\nPIs: Deborah Khider, Julien Emile-Geay, Nicholas McKay NSF Award: ICER 2126510 Period: 09/01/2021 – 08/31/2026\n\nPaleoCube lowers social and technical barriers in paleoclimatology by bringing scientists to work in the Cloud. The project extends existing cyberinfrastructure (LinkedEarth, Pangeo, Jupyter) and the scientific Python ecosystem to provide free access to interactive computing at scale. Key components include: (1) a knowledge base for paleoclimate records supporting complex querying, (2) software to query and manipulate LiPD datasets, (3) software libraries for analyzing paleoclimate time series, and (4) a gallery of exemplar notebooks and tutorials. A major achievement has been to extend NumPy and Pandas to accommodate non-nanosecond dtypes, thereby opening pandas to the 4.5 billion years of Earth’s history.\nBlog posts: PaleoBooks, LinkedEarth Hub\nPublications: Ratnakar and Khider (2025)\n\n\nPReSto: A Paleoclimate Reconstruction Storehouse\nPIs: Nick McKay (NAU), Julien Emile-Geay (USC), Deborah Khider (ISI) NSF Award: EAR 1948822 Period: 07/01/2020 – 06/30/2026\nPReSto provides broad access to paleoclimate reconstructions through an integrated web-based platform. The project connects a steadily growing digital collection of paleoclimate data to evolving methodologies and effectively visualizes results through a web portal. PReSto pilots on two complementary time periods: the Common Era (past 2,000 years) with monthly and annual records, and the Holocene (past ~12,000 years) at lower temporal resolution. The project includes capacity-building workshops for data stewards and early-career researchers.\nPublications: Manety et al (2022), Zhu et al. (2023), Zhu et al. (2024), Emile-Geay et al. (2025)\nBlog Posts: paleoclimate ensembles"

Houston), C. Thackeray (UCLA)\nPeriod: 09/01/2020 – 08/31/2025\n\nThis grant funded 3 main activities: (1) further development of the Pyleoclim package (esp an extensive documentation and tutorials) and outreach to the worldwide community via 3 virtual hackathons and one in-person hackathon; (2) exploration of the presence of abrupt and smooth shifts in hydroclimate regimes over the past glacial cycles; (3) developement of emergent constraints on equilibrium climate sensitivity from climate reconstructions and simulations of the past millennium. The development of the Pyleoclim Package was also supported by a grant from JP Morgan.\n\nPublications: Khider et al. (2022), Cropper et al, (2023), James et al. (2024), James et al. (2025a), James et al. (2025b)\n\n\nTowards Reflection Competencies for AI Scientists: Developing a Conceptual Framework and Open Research Platform.\nOffice of Naval Research PIs: Yolanda Gil Period: 06/01/2021 - 05/31/2023\nAs scientific questions become more complex, the capabilities of scientists to do research will need to be augmented with AI systems. This project will develop an open architecture for cognitive AI scientists that can formulate scientific questions, devise strategies to answer them, and place new findings in the context of the original question. A core aspects of this research is capturing scientific knowledge to reason about open questions, construct plausible hypotheses, formulate appropriate methods to test them, and interpret the results obtained.\n\n\nAutomating Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis.\nJP Morgan Award PIs: Yolanda Gil, Deborah Khider Period: 03/01/2019 - 01/31/2022\nThe goal of this project was to automate time series analysis. This would enable non-experts to analyze time series data with high-quality, proven methods, and would also allow efficient analysis of the vasts amount of timeseries data available.\nPublications: Khider et al. 2020\n\n\nBelmont Forum Collaborative Research: Abrupt Change in Climate and Ecosystems: Where are the Tipping Points?\nAward: Belmont Forum via NSF, ICER 1929554 Period: 07/01/2019 – 06/30/2022\nNICK PLEASE WRITE and refer to actR\n\n\nCollaborative Research: LinkedEarth: Crowdsourcing Data Curation & Standards Development in Paleoclimatology\nNSF Award: ICER 1541029 PIs: Julien Emile-Geay, Yolanda Gil, Nick McKay Period: 09/01/2015 – 08/31/2019\n\nOur namesake grant, which kickstarted collaboration within the core team, back when Deborah was a postdoc. LinkedEarth aimed to leverage semantic web technologies to crowdsource the curation of paleoclimate datasets and compilations. The project led to the developement of the LinkedEarth wiki (now defunct) and the PaCTS reporting standard, obtained through extensive community consultation, particularly through a meeting at the World Data Service for Paleoclimatology in Boulder, CO in 2016.\nPublications: Gil et al, (2017), Khider et al (2019) Products: LinkedEarth Ontology\n\n\nCollaborative Research: GeoChronR - open-source tools for the analysis, visualization and integration of time-uncertain geoscientific data\nNSF Award: EAR 1347213 PIs: Nick McKay, Julien Emile-Geay Period: 07/01/2014 – 06/30/2018\n\nGeoChronR is an integrated framework in the R language that allows scientists to generate state-of-the-art age models for their records, create time-uncertain ensembles of their data, analyze those ensembles with a number of commonly-used techniques, and visualize their results in an intuitive way. This grant funded the development of the package, as well as 2 workshops (2016, 2017 in Flagstaff, AZ) to disseminate its use. In parallel, GeoChronR motivated the creation of the Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) framework, which is at the root of many LinkedEarth data endeavors.\nPublications: McKay & Emile-Geay (2016), McKay et al. (2021)"
